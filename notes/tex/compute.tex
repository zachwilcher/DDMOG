\section{Computation}

\begin{proposition}
There are 
\(\displaystyle
\sum_{k=0}^{\binom{n}{2}} \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{k} 2^k = 3^{\binom{n}{2}}
\)
oriented graphs on \(n\) vertices.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
There are \(\binom{n}{2}\) edges in \(K_n\).
For each number \(k\) of possible edges from \(0\) to \(\binom{n}{2}\)
we have \(\binom{n(n+1)/2}{k}\) ways to put undirected edges between
vertices.
For each placement of \(k\) possible edges, there
are \(2^k\) possible orientations of those edges.
Using the binomial theorem, the resulting sum can be simplified.
\end{proof}

So, an algorithm that checks if every possible oriented graph is magic is at least \(O(3^{n^2})\).
If 50000 graphs can be checked in 1 second, then to check every graph on 7 vertices
we would need at least 58 hours.
